# Project on Bangladeshi River Scene Simulation using OpenGL
### Objective
● To implement a computer graphics project on Bangladeshi River Scene using OpenGL
### Working Materials    
● Moderate Configured PC (Windows 10.0)  
● C compiler (code-blocks)  
● Glut accommodated setup  
### Description
We created a River scenario of a typical Bangladeshi village using OpenGL. Here, we’ve
implemented two village houses, five trees, a background hill, a sun, a moon, four stars, a river
and three moving boats. There are two modes of scene here,
1. Day (press **D** or **d** from keyboard)
2. Night (press **N** or **n** from keyboard)  

Stars and Moon are visible at night and sun is visible only at Daytime.
